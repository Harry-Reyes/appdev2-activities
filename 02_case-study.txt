Agile Management is the first aspect to handle. It's good to have plans carefully plotted out. The problem is the distribution of the tasks. With a long span to finish the project, order the backlogs into sprints. Doing that, the tasks with high priority are in the early stage of development before the next sprint. Scrum ceremonies are a crucial part of tracking the progress of what has been finished in the project because communication is one of the keys to success.
If the second problem is that the company is short-staffed, then it is time to hire more developers or a dedicated Quality Assurance team. If the company has enough human resources, it needs to identify the skill sets of each one of them.
